# Awesome Vision Foundation Models Unifying Understanding and Generation
Similar to LLM, building a generalist foundation model to solve all vision tasks has become a very popular trend. We conduct the first survey to provide comprehensive summary and in-depth analysis on vision foundation models unifying both understanding and generation. This repository provides a curated list of related papers and resources. Please stay tuned and give us a ðŸŒŸ if you are interested in our project, we will update the latest advancements continuously.
